The **Heckler & Koch MP5 K**, known in-game as the **MP5k**, is a 9mm burst pistol. It was added to the game in the [v0.24.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.24.0) "Remembrance" update on February 25th, 2025. It shoots fast, in 3-round bursts, and is dual-wieldable for even faster bursts of damage.

# Background

The MP5 K is a redesigned variant of Heckler & Koch's MP5 that was introduced in 1976. This version is notably more compact than its predecessor, with the K standing for *Kurz*, which is German for "short". Changes to the MP5 K include a shorter inch barrel, a integrated foregrip, and most notably a sling mount in place of a stock. The MP5 K's compact design was created for special forces and bodyguards due to its easily concealable nature, there was even a version that was built into a briefcase that was used for more covert operations. The MP5 K has seen use in the British Royalty Protection Branch and even with the Navy SEALs.

# Strategies

## Using

- The MP5k is a surprisingly good weapon for how early in the game you can obtain it, so therefore you should utilize that to your advantage by using it to pick off early game opponents.
- A single MP5k is comparable to the [SAF-200](weapons/guns/saf200), while dual-wielding is comparable to the [MP40](weapons/guns/mp40) or even the [Vector](weapons/guns/vector). With this in mind, you should strategize accordingly.
  - The MP5k also has a range of 100, which is right between the [SAF-200](weapons/guns/saf200) and the [Vector](weapons/guns/vector), and you can essentially treat it as a breed between the two.
- Using either a single or dual MP5k with good aim can actually output a solid amount of DPS.
  - Additionally, dual wielding as of right now doesn't affect the spread of the weapon, meaning you can effectively double your DPS and magazine capacity with the only cost being reload speed.
- Dual wielding gives the highest ammo capacity out of any 9mm weapon in the game as of now, even the [Vector](weapons/guns/vector).
- Maintain some distance from your enemies, as even though the DPS is very solid, there are still plenty of close-range options that can take you down, especially in the event of an ambush.

## Countering

- Other high DPS weapons can easily catch MP5k users off guard, which is why you should use surprise to your advantage.
  - Most other mid to high-tier can easily out DPS the MP5k.
- Like the [SAF-200](weapons/guns/saf200) or [M16A2](weapons/guns/m16a2), if an opponent only has one MP5k, then you can weave in between bursts to close the distance or run to cover.

# Obtaining

- The MP5k is a fairly common weapon in the game. It can be found occasionally as ground loot, in crates, or in buildings.

# Trivia

- The MP5 K is technically classified as an SMG according to Heckler & Koch despite being labeled as a pistol.
  - This is most likely due to this weapon needing to be dual-wieldable for gameplay reasons, though realistically it would make more sense for something like the [Micro Uzi](weapons/guns/micro_uzi) to be dual-wieldable due to size.
